                            On April 26, 1989, Game Freak was founded by Sugimori and his long time business partner, Satoshi Tajiri. Together, the two created Pokémon and release Pokémon Red
                            and Green for the Gameboy in Japan. Pokémon Blue was also released in Japan at a later time, and was used in lieu of Pokémon Green for the international release of the games.

                            For Pokémon Black and White, Sugimori directed a team of 17 other artists when designing the new characters, though he would typically have the last call on character design. 
                            While Sugimori's style has changed over the years, much of his design process has stayed the same, in that characters will go through several iterations before being released
                            to the public. When designing a new Pokemon, Sugimori stated that <em>"I do feel that I always want to show new Pokemon that people have never seen before. To do that, I think of ways 
                                    that I can surprise the players,"</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Sugimori" alt="wiki quote" title="To the Ken Sugimori Wiki">Wikipedia</a>).
